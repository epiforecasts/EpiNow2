The `estimate_infections()` function encodes a range of different model options.
In this vignette we apply some of these to the example data provided with the _EpiNow2_ package, highlighting differences in inference results and run times. 
It is not meant as a comprehensive exploration of all the functionality in the package, but intended to give users a flavour of the kind of model options that exist for reproduction number estimation and forecasting within the package, and the differences in computational speed between them.
For mathematical detail on the model please consult the [model definition](estimate_infections.html) vignette, and for a more general description of the use of the function, the [estimate_infections workflow](estimate_infections_workflow.html) vignette.

# Set up

We first load the _EpiNow2_ package and also the _rstan_ package that we will use later to show the differences in run times between different model options.


```r
library("EpiNow2")
library("rstan")
#> Loading required package: StanHeaders
#> 
#> rstan version 2.33.1.9000 (Stan version 2.33.0)
#> For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
#> options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()).
#> To avoid recompilation of unchanged Stan programs, we recommend calling
#> rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
#> For within-chain threading using `reduce_sum()` or `map_rect()` Stan functions,
#> change `threads_per_chain` option:
#> rstan_options(threads_per_chain = 1)
```

In this examples we set the number of cores to use to 4 but the optimal value here will depend on the computing resources available.


```r
options(mc.cores = 4)
```

# Data

We will use an example data set that is included in the package, representing an outbreak of COVID-19 with an initial rapid increase followed by decreasing incidence.


```r
library("ggplot2")
reported_cases <- example_confirmed[1:60]
ggplot(reported_cases, aes(x =  date, y = confirm)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Cases")
```

# Parameters

Before running the model we need to decide on some parameter values, in particular any delays, the generation time, and a prior on the initial reproduction number.

## Delays: incubation period and reporting delay

Delays reflect the time that passes between infection and reporting, if these exist. In this example, we assume two delays, an _incubation period_ (i.e. delay from infection to symptom onset) and a _reporting delay_ (i.e. the delay from symptom onset to being recorded as a symptomatic case). These delays are usually not the same for everyone and are instead characterised by a distribution. For the incubation period we use an example from the literature that is included in the package.


```r
incubation_period <- get_incubation_period(
  disease = "SARS-CoV-2", source = "lauer"
)
#> Warning: The meaning of the 'max' argument has changed compared to previous versions. It now indicates the maximum of a distribution rather than the length of the probability mass function (including 0) that it represented previously. To replicate previous behaviour reduce max by 1.
#> This warning is displayed onc every 8 hours.
#> This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
incubation_period
#> 
#>   Uncertain lognormal distribution with (untruncated) logmean 1.6 (SD 0.064) and logSD 0.42 (SD 0.069)
```

For the reporting delay, we use a lognormal distribution with mean of 2 days and standard deviation of 1 day.
Note that the mean and standard deviation must be converted to the log scale, which can be done using the `convert_log_logmean()` function.


```r
reporting_delay <- dist_spec(
  mean = convert_to_logmean(2, 1), mean_sd = 0,
  sd = convert_to_logsd(2, 1), sd_sd = 0, max = 10
)
reporting_delay
#> 
#>   Fixed distribution with PMF [0.11 0.48 0.27 0.093 0.029 0.0096 0.0033 0.0012 0.00045 0.00018 7.4e-05]
```

_EpiNow2_ provides a feature that allows us to combine these delays into one by summing them up


```r
delay <- incubation_period + reporting_delay
delay
#> 
#> Combination of delay distributions:
#>   Uncertain lognormal distribution with (untruncated) logmean 1.6 (SD 0.064) and logSD 0.42 (SD 0.069)
#>   Fixed distribution with PMF [0.11 0.48 0.27 0.093 0.029 0.0096 0.0033 0.0012 0.00045 0.00018 7.4e-05]
```

## Generation time

If we want to estimate the reproduction number we need to provide a distribution of generation times. Here again we use an example from the literature that is included with the package.


```r
generation_time <- get_generation_time(
  disease = "SARS-CoV-2", source = "ganyani"
)
generation_time
#> 
#>   Uncertain gamma distribution with (untruncated) mean 3.6 (SD 0.71) and SD 3.1 (SD 0.77)
```

## Initial reproduction number

Lastly we need to choose a prior for the initial value of the reproduction number. This is assumed by the model to be normally distributed and we can set the mean and the standard deviation. We decide to set the mean to 2 and the standard deviation to 1.


```r
rt_prior <- list(mean = 2, sd = 0.1)
```

# Running the model

We are now ready to run the model and will in the following show a number of possible options for doing so.

## Default options

By default the model uses a renewal equation for infections and a Gaussian Process prior for the reproduction number. 
Putting all the data and parameters together and tweaking the Gaussian Process to have a shorter length scale prior than the default we run.


```r
def <- estimate_infections(reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = rt_prior)
)

#> Warning: Tail Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior variances and tail quantiles may be unreliable.

## Reducing the accuracy of the approximate Gaussian Process

To speed up the calculation of the Gaussian Process we could decrease its accuracy, e.g. decrease the proportion of time points to use as basis functions from the default of 0.2 to 0.1.


```r
agp <- estimate_infections(reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = rt_prior),
  gp = gp_opts(basis_prop = 0.1)
)
#> Warning: There were 7 divergent transitions after warmup. See
#> https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup
#> to find out why this is a problem and how to eliminate them.
#> Warning: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
# summarise results
summary(agp)
#>                                  measure                 estimate
#> 1: New confirmed cases by infection date      2322 (1213 -- 4472)
#> 2:        Expected change in daily cases        Likely decreasing
#> 3:            Effective reproduction no.       0.89 (0.63 -- 1.2)
#> 4:                        Rate of growth -0.025 (-0.091 -- 0.038)
#> 5:          Doubling/halving time (days)         -27 (18 -- -7.6)

# summary plot
plot(agp)
```

## Adjusting for future susceptible depletion

We might want to adjust for future susceptible depletion.
Here, we do so by setting the population to 1000000 and projecting the reproduction number from the latest estimate (rather than the default, which fixes the reproduction number to an earlier time point based on the given reporting delays).
Note that this only affects the forecasts and is done using a crude adjustment (see the [model definition](estimate_infections.html)).


```r
dep <- estimate_infections(reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  rt = rt_opts(
    prior = rt_prior,
    pop = 1000000, future = "latest"
  )
)
#> Warning: There were 5 divergent transitions after warmup. See
#> https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup
#> to find out why this is a problem and how to eliminate them.
#> Warning: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
# summarise results
summary(dep)
#>                                  measure                 estimate
#> 1: New confirmed cases by infection date      2259 (1153 -- 4268)
#> 2:        Expected change in daily cases        Likely decreasing
#> 3:            Effective reproduction no.       0.88 (0.62 -- 1.2)
#> 4:                        Rate of growth -0.027 (-0.095 -- 0.035)
#> 5:          Doubling/halving time (days)         -25 (20 -- -7.3)
# elapsed time (in seconds)

#> chain:2 36.141 24.833

#> chain:4 41.159 52.056
# summary plot
plot(dep)
```

## Adjusting for truncation of the most recent data

We might further want to adjust for right-truncation of recent data estimated using the [estimate_truncation](estimate_truncation.html) model.
Here, instead of doing so we assume that we know about truncation with mean of 1/2 day, sd 1/2 day, following a lognormal distribution and with a maximum of three days.


```r
trunc_dist <- dist_spec(
  mean = convert_to_logmean(0.5, 0.5), mean_sd = 0.1,
  sd = convert_to_logsd(0.5, 0.5), sd_sd = 0.1,
  max = 3
)
```

We can then use this in the `esimtate_infections()` function using the `truncation` option.


```r
trunc <- estimate_infections(reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  truncation = trunc_opts(trunc_dist),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = rt_prior)
)
#> Warning: There were 1 divergent transitions after warmup. See

#> 2:        Expected change in daily cases       Likely decreasing

```

## Projecting the reproduction number with the Gaussian Process

Instead of keeping the reproduction number fixed from a certain time point we might want to extrapolate the Gaussian Process into the future. 
This will lead to wider uncertainty, and the researcher should check whether this or fixing the reproduction number from an earlier is desirable.


```r
project_rt <- estimate_infections(reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  rt = rt_opts(
    prior = rt_prior, future = "project"
  )
)
#> Warning: There were 14 divergent transitions after warmup. See

#> to find out why this is a problem and how to eliminate them.
#> Warning: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
# summarise results

#>                                  measure                 estimate
#> 1: New confirmed cases by infection date      2292 (1144 -- 4280)
#> 2:        Expected change in daily cases        Likely decreasing
#> 3:            Effective reproduction no.       0.88 (0.62 -- 1.2)
#> 4:                        Rate of growth -0.026 (-0.095 -- 0.036)
#> 5:          Doubling/halving time (days)         -27 (19 -- -7.3)

```

## Fixed reproduction number

We might want to estimate a fixed reproduction number, i.e. assume that it does not change.


```r
fixed <- estimate_infections(reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  gp = NULL
)
# summarise results
summary(fixed)
#>                                  measure               estimate
#> 1: New confirmed cases by infection date  15813 (8914 -- 28821)
#> 2:        Expected change in daily cases             Increasing
#> 3:            Effective reproduction no.       1.2 (1.1 -- 1.2)
#> 4:                        Rate of growth 0.038 (0.026 -- 0.049)
#> 5:          Doubling/halving time (days)          18 (14 -- 27)
# elapsed time (in seconds)
get_elapsed_time(fixed$fit)
#>         warmup sample
#> chain:1  1.615  1.093
#> chain:2  1.964  1.228
#> chain:3  1.954  0.840
#> chain:4  1.386  0.692
# summary plot
plot(fixed)
```

![plot of chunk fixed](figure/fixed-1.png)

## Breakpoints

Instead of assuming the reproduction number varies freely or is fixed, we can assume that it is fixed but with breakpoints.
This can be done by adding a `breakpoint` column to the reported case data set.
e.g. if we think that the reproduction number was constant but would like to allow it to change on the 16th of March 2020 we would define a new case data set using


```r
bp_cases <- data.table::copy(reported_cases)
bp_cases <- bp_cases[,
 breakpoint := ifelse(date == as.Date("2020-03-16"), 1, 0)
]
```

We then use this instead of `reported_cases` in the `estimate_infections()` function:


```r
bkp <- estimate_infections(bp_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = rt_prior),
  gp = NULL
)
# summarise results
summary(bkp)
#>                                  measure                 estimate
#> 1: New confirmed cases by infection date      2482 (2047 -- 2989)
#> 2:        Expected change in daily cases               Decreasing
#> 3:            Effective reproduction no.      0.91 (0.88 -- 0.93)
#> 4:                        Rate of growth -0.02 (-0.026 -- -0.015)
#> 5:          Doubling/halving time (days)         -34 (-46 -- -27)
# elapsed time (in seconds)

#> chain:1  2.864  2.679
#> chain:2  3.296  2.027

#> chain:4  3.046  2.688
# summary plot
plot(bkp)
```

![plot of chunk bp](figure/bp-1.png)

## Weekly random walk

Instead of a smooth Gaussian Process we might want the reproduction number to change step-wise, e.g. every week.
This can be achieved using the `rw` option which defines the length of the time step in a random walk that the reproduction number is assumed to follow.


```r
rw <- estimate_infections(reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = rt_prior, rw = 7),
  gp = NULL
)
# summarise results
summary(rw)
#>                                  measure                 estimate
#> 1: New confirmed cases by infection date      2131 (1133 -- 4131)
#> 2:        Expected change in daily cases        Likely decreasing
#> 3:            Effective reproduction no.       0.86 (0.63 -- 1.2)
#> 4:                        Rate of growth -0.032 (-0.092 -- 0.032)
#> 5:          Doubling/halving time (days)         -22 (22 -- -7.5)

## No delays

Whilst _EpiNow2_ allows the user to specify delays, it can also run directly on the data as does e.g. the [EpiEstim](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=EpiEstim) package.


```r
no_delay <- estimate_infections(
  reported_cases,

## Non-parametric infection model

The package also includes a non-parametric infection model.
This runs much faster but does not use the renewal equation to generate infections.
Because of this none of the options defining the behaviour of the reproduction number are available in this case, limiting user choice and model generality.
It also means that the model is questionable for forecasting, which is why were here set the predictive horizon to 0.


```r
non_parametric <- estimate_infections(reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  rt = NULL,
  backcalc = backcalc_opts(),
  horizon = 0
)
