## Quick start

In the following section we give an overview of the simple use case for `epinow()` and `regional_epinow()`.

The first step to using the package is to load it as follows.


```r
library(EpiNow2)
```

### Reporting delays, incubation period and generation time

Distributions can be supplied in two ways. First, by supplying delay data to `estimate_delay()`, where a subsampled bootstrapped lognormal will be fit to account for uncertainty in the observed data without being biased by changes in incidence (see `?EpiNow2::estimate_delay()`).

Second, by specifying predetermined delays with uncertainty using `dist_spec()`. An arbitrary number of delay distributions are supported in `dist_spec()` with the most common use case likely to be an incubation period followed by a reporting delay (see `?EpiNow2::dist_spec()`).

For example if data on the delay between onset and infection was available we could fit a distribution to it, using `estimate_delay()`, with appropriate uncertainty as follows (note this is a synthetic example),

```r
reporting_delay <- estimate_delay(
  rlnorm(1000, log(2), 1),
  max_value = 14, bootstraps = 1
)
```

If data was not available we could instead specify an informed estimate of the likely delay
using `dist_spec()`. To demonstrate, we choose a lognormal distribution with mean 2, standard deviation 1 (both with some uncertainty) and a maximum of 10. *This is just an example and unlikely to apply in any particular use case*.


```r
reporting_delay <- dist_spec(
  mean = convert_to_logmean(2, 1),
  mean_sd = 0.1,
  sd = convert_to_logsd(2, 1),
  sd_sd = 0.1,
  max = 10,
  distribution = "lognormal"
)
```

```
## Warning: The meaning of the 'max' argument has changed compared to previous versions. It now indicates the maximum of a distribution rather than the length of the probability mass function (including 0) that it represented previously. To replicate previous behaviour reduce max by 1.
## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
```

```r
reporting_delay
```

```
## 
##   Uncertain lognormal distribution with (untruncated) logmean 0.58 (SD 0.1) and logSD 0.47 (SD 0.1)
```

For the rest of this vignette, we will use inbuilt example literature estimates for the incubation period and generation time of Covid-19 (see [here](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2/tree/main/data-raw) for the code that generates these estimates). *These distributions are unlikely to be applicable for your use case. We strongly recommend investigating what might be the best distributions to use in any given use case.*


```r
example_generation_time
```

```
## 
##   Uncertain gamma distribution with (untruncated) mean 3.6 (SD 0.71) and SD 3.1 (SD 0.77)
```

```r
example_incubation_period
```

```
## 
##   Uncertain lognormal distribution with (untruncated) logmean 1.6 (SD 0.064) and logSD 0.42 (SD 0.069)
```

Now, to the functions.

### [epinow()](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/epinow.html)

This function represents the core functionality of the package and includes results reporting, plotting, and optional saving. It requires a data frame of cases by date of report and the distributions defined above.

Load example case data from `{EpiNow2}`.


```r
reported_cases <- example_confirmed[1:60]
head(reported_cases)
```

```
##          date confirm
## 1: 2020-02-22      14
## 2: 2020-02-23      62
## 3: 2020-02-24      53
## 4: 2020-02-25      97
## 5: 2020-02-26      93
## 6: 2020-02-27      78
```

Estimate cases by date of infection, the time-varying reproduction number, the rate of growth, and forecast these estimates into the future by 7 days. Summarise the posterior and return a summary table and plots for reporting purposes. If a `target_folder` is supplied results can be internally saved (with the option to also turn off explicit returning of results). Here we use the default model parameterisation that prioritises real-time performance over run-time or other considerations. For other formulations see the documentation for `estimate_infections()`.


```r
estimates <- epinow(
  reported_cases = reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(example_generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(example_incubation_period + reporting_delay),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = list(mean = 2, sd = 0.2)),
  stan = stan_opts(cores = 4, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)),
  verbose = interactive()
)
```

```
## DEBUG [2023-11-24 16:30:24] epinow: Running in exact mode for 2000 samples (across 4 chains each with a warm up of 250 iterations each) and 79 time steps of which 7 are a forecast
```

```r
names(estimates)
```

```
## [1] "estimates"                "estimated_reported_cases" "summary"                 
## [4] "plots"                    "timing"
```

Both summary measures and posterior samples are returned for all parameters in an easily explored format which can be accessed using `summary`. The default is to return a summary table of estimates for key parameters at the latest date partially supported by data. 


```r
knitr::kable(summary(estimates))
```



|measure                               |estimate               |
|:-------------------------------------|:----------------------|
|New confirmed cases by infection date |2274 (1099 -- 4314)    |
|Expected change in daily cases        |Likely decreasing      |
|Effective reproduction no.            |0.88 (0.6 -- 1.2)      |
|Rate of growth                        |-0.027 (-0.1 -- 0.037) |
|Doubling/halving time (days)          |-25 (19 -- -6.8)       |

Summarised parameter estimates can also easily be returned, either filtered for a single parameter or for all parameters.


```r
head(summary(estimates, type = "parameters", params = "R"))
```

A range of plots are returned (with the single summary plot shown below). These plots can also be generated using the following `plot` method.


```r
plot(estimates)
```

### [regional_epinow()](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/regional_epinow.html)

The `regional_epinow()` function runs the `epinow()` function across multiple regions in
an efficient manner.

Define cases in multiple regions delineated by the region variable.


```r
reported_cases <- data.table::rbindlist(list(
  data.table::copy(reported_cases)[, region := "testland"],
  reported_cases[, region := "realland"]
))
head(reported_cases)
```

```
##          date confirm   region
## 1: 2020-02-22      14 testland
## 2: 2020-02-23      62 testland
## 3: 2020-02-24      53 testland
## 4: 2020-02-25      97 testland
## 5: 2020-02-26      93 testland
## 6: 2020-02-27      78 testland
```

Calling `regional_epinow()` runs the `epinow()` on each region in turn (or in parallel depending on the settings used). Here we switch to using a weekly random walk rather than the full Gaussian process model giving us piecewise constant estimates by week.


```r
estimates <- regional_epinow(
  reported_cases = reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(example_generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(example_incubation_period + reporting_delay),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = list(mean = 2, sd = 0.2), rw = 7),
  gp = NULL,
  stan = stan_opts(cores = 4, warmup = 250, samples = 1000)
)
```

Results from each region are stored in a `regional` list with across region summary measures and plots stored in a `summary` list. All results can be set to be internally saved by setting the `target_folder` and `summary_dir` arguments. Each region can be estimated in parallel using the `{future}` package (when in most scenarios `cores` should be set to 1). For routine use each MCMC chain can also be run in parallel (with `future` = TRUE) with a time out (`max_execution_time`) allowing for partial results to be returned if a subset of chains is running longer than expected. See the documentation for the `{future}` package for details on nested futures.

Summary measures that are returned include a table formatted for reporting (along with raw results for further processing). Futures updated will extend the S3 methods used above to smooth access to this output.

knitr::kable(estimates$summary$summarised_results$table)
