## Quick start

In the following section we give an overview of the simple use case for `epinow()` and `regional_epinow()`.

The first step to using the package is to load it as follows.


```r
library(EpiNow2)
```

### Reporting delays, incubation period and generation time

Distributions can be supplied in two ways. First, one can supplying delay data to `estimate_delay()`, where a subsampled bootstrapped lognormal will be fit to account for uncertainty in the observed data without being biased by changes in incidence (see `?EpiNow2::estimate_delay()`).

Second, one can specify predetermined delays with uncertainty using the distribution functions such as `Gamma` or `Lognormal`. An arbitrary number of delay distributions are supported in `dist_spec()` with a common use case being an incubation period followed by a reporting delay. For more information on specifying distributions see (see `?EpiNow2::Distributions`).

For example if data on the delay between onset and infection was available we could fit a distribution to it, using `estimate_delay()`, with appropriate uncertainty as follows (note this is a synthetic example),

```r
reporting_delay <- estimate_delay(
  rlnorm(1000, log(2), 1),
  max_value = 14, bootstraps = 1
)
```

If data was not available we could instead specify an informed estimate of the likely delay using the distribution functions `Gamma` or `LogNormal`. 
To demonstrate, we choose a lognormal distribution with mean 2, standard deviation 1 and a maximum of 10. *This is just an example and unlikely to apply in any particular use case*.


```r
reporting_delay <- LogNormal(mean = 2, sd = 1, max = 10)
reporting_delay
```

```
## - lognormal distribution (max: 10):
##   meanlog:
##     0.58
##   sdlog:
##     0.47
```

For the rest of this vignette, we will use inbuilt example literature estimates for the incubation period and generation time of Covid-19 (see [here](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2/tree/main/data-raw) for the code that generates these estimates). *These distributions are unlikely to be applicable for your use case. We strongly recommend investigating what might be the best distributions to use in any given use case.*


```r
example_generation_time
```

```
## - gamma distribution (max: 14):
##   shape:
##     - normal distribution:
##       mean:
##         1.4
##       sd:
##         0.48
##   rate:
##     - normal distribution:
##       mean:
##         0.38
##       sd:
##         0.25
```

```r
example_incubation_period
```

```
## - lognormal distribution (max: 14):
##   meanlog:
##     - normal distribution:
##       mean:
##         1.6
##       sd:
##         0.064
##   sdlog:
##     - normal distribution:
##       mean:
##         0.42
##       sd:
##         0.069
```

Now, to the functions.

### [epinow()](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/epinow.html)

This function represents the core functionality of the package and includes results reporting, plotting, and optional saving. It requires a data frame of cases by date of report and the distributions defined above.

Load example case data from `{EpiNow2}`.


```r
reported_cases <- example_confirmed[1:60]
head(reported_cases)
```

```
##          date confirm
##        <Date>   <num>
## 1: 2020-02-22      14
## 2: 2020-02-23      62
## 3: 2020-02-24      53
## 4: 2020-02-25      97
## 5: 2020-02-26      93
## 6: 2020-02-27      78
```

Estimate cases by date of infection, the time-varying reproduction number, the rate of growth, and forecast these estimates into the future by 7 days. Summarise the posterior and return a summary table and plots for reporting purposes. If a `target_folder` is supplied results can be internally saved (with the option to also turn off explicit returning of results). Here we use the default model parameterisation that prioritises real-time performance over run-time or other considerations. For other formulations see the documentation for `estimate_infections()`.


```r
estimates <- epinow(
  data = reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(example_generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(example_incubation_period + reporting_delay),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = list(mean = 2, sd = 0.2)),
  stan = stan_opts(cores = 4, control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)),
  verbose = interactive()
)
```

```
## DEBUG [2024-03-06 10:56:48] epinow: Running in exact mode for 2000 samples (across 4 chains each with a warm up of 250 iterations each) and 81 time steps of which 7 are a forecast

```

```r
names(estimates)
```

```
## [1] "estimates"                "estimated_reported_cases" "summary"                 
## [4] "plots"                    "timing"
```

Both summary measures and posterior samples are returned for all parameters in an easily explored format which can be accessed using `summary`. The default is to return a summary table of estimates for key parameters at the latest date partially supported by data. 


```r
knitr::kable(summary(estimates))
```



|measure                          |estimate                |
|:--------------------------------|:-----------------------|
|New infections per day           |2200 (951 -- 4666)      |
|Expected change in daily reports |Likely decreasing       |
|Effective reproduction no.       |0.87 (0.57 -- 1.2)      |
|Rate of growth                   |-0.035 (-0.16 -- 0.067) |
|Doubling/halving time (days)     |-20 (10 -- -4.4)        |

Summarised parameter estimates can also easily be returned, either filtered for a single parameter or for all parameters.


```r
head(summary(estimates, type = "parameters", params = "R"))
```

```

A range of plots are returned (with the single summary plot shown below). These plots can also be generated using the following `plot` method.


```r
plot(estimates)
```

### [regional_epinow()](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/regional_epinow.html)

The `regional_epinow()` function runs the `epinow()` function across multiple regions in
an efficient manner.

Define cases in multiple regions delineated by the region variable.


```r
reported_cases <- data.table::rbindlist(list(
  data.table::copy(reported_cases)[, region := "testland"],
  reported_cases[, region := "realland"]
))
head(reported_cases)
```

```
##          date confirm   region
##        <Date>   <num>   <char>
## 1: 2020-02-22      14 testland
## 2: 2020-02-23      62 testland
## 3: 2020-02-24      53 testland
## 4: 2020-02-25      97 testland
## 5: 2020-02-26      93 testland
## 6: 2020-02-27      78 testland
```

Calling `regional_epinow()` runs the `epinow()` on each region in turn (or in parallel depending on the settings used). Here we switch to using a weekly random walk rather than the full Gaussian process model giving us piecewise constant estimates by week.


```r
estimates <- regional_epinow(
  data = reported_cases,
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(example_generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(example_incubation_period + reporting_delay),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = list(mean = 2, sd = 0.2), rw = 7),
  gp = NULL,
  stan = stan_opts(cores = 4, warmup = 250, samples = 1000)
)
```

Results from each region are stored in a `regional` list with across region summary measures and plots stored in a `summary` list. All results can be set to be internally saved by setting the `target_folder` and `summary_dir` arguments. Each region can be estimated in parallel using the `{future}` package (when in most scenarios `cores` should be set to 1). For routine use each MCMC chain can also be run in parallel (with `future` = TRUE) with a time out (`max_execution_time`) allowing for partial results to be returned if a subset of chains is running longer than expected. See the documentation for the `{future}` package for details on nested futures.

Summary measures that are returned include a table formatted for reporting (along with raw results for further processing). Futures updated will extend the S3 methods used above to smooth access to this output.


```r
knitr::kable(estimates$summary$summarised_results$table)
```



|Region   |New infections per day |Expected change in daily reports |Effective reproduction no. |Rate of growth          |Doubling/halving time (days) |
