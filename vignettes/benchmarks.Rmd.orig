In using `{EpiNow2}`, users will often be faced with two decision points that will guide their choice of an appropriate model: (i) use case: retrospective vs real-time analysis, and (ii) limited computing resources. `{EpiNow2}` provides a range of customisations of the default model to suit these decision points.

The aim of this vignette is to show how these model customisations affect the speed and accuracy of the model. We will benchmark four (4) `{EpiNow2}` model options, including the default model and customisations in the default prior on how $R_t$ is generated and evolves over time. These models are chosen to cover a range of use cases.

We will analyse the estimation and forecasting performance of these models when solved with MCMC sampling. `{EpiNow2}` also provides other approximate sampling methods to solve these models ([variational inference](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/variational_config.html), [pathfinder method](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/pathfinder_config.html), and [laplace sampling](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/laplace_sample_config.html)). These algorithms are  unstable, however, hence not recommended for use in production pipelines, so we will not emphasise their use. We will, however, highlight how the models perform when solved with these approximate sampling methods and provide an overview of when they may be appropriate.

For the benchmarking exercise, we will compare the models based on their runtimes and the accuracy of estimates on complete and partial data, taken at 3 time points of a simulated epidemic: (i) the growth phase, (ii) the peak, and (iii) the decline phase.

## The benchmarking data

We will start by setting up the "true" dataset with known trajectories of $R_t$ and infections using `{EpiNow2}`'s `forecast_infections()` function. The steps to generate the true $R_t$ trajectory below reflects the idea that by using the posterior for quantity but the $R_t$ trajectory, we will achieve a simulation that accurately reflects a real world setting while still being able to know and change the true trajectory.

Let's proceed. The infection similution function, `forecast_infections()`, requires a fitted estimates object from `epinow()` with `output` set to "fit", the trajectory of the reproduction number, `R`, and the number of samples to simulate. So, we will set these up first.

To obtain the `estimates` object, we will run the `epinow()` function using real-world observed data and delay distributions to recover realistic parameter values. For the `data`, we will use the first $60$ observations of the `example_confirmed` data set. We will use the `example_generation_time` for the generation time, and the `example_incubation_period`, and `example_reporting_delay` to specify  and delays. These come with the package. For the `rt` model, we will use a 14-day random walk prior, with a mean of $2$ and standard deviation of $0.1$. As we only want to generate estimates, we will turn off forecasting by setting `horizon = 0`.

Throughout this vignette, several argument values, including the observation model options, the rt model prior will be maintained, so we will define them here. Note that we use `r detectCores() - 1` cores out of `r detectCores()` cores and this affects the time it takes to run the models.

```{r share_inputs}
# Observation model options
obs <- obs_opts(
  scale = Normal(0.1, 0.025),
  return_likelihood = TRUE
)
# Rt prior
rt_prior_default <- Normal(2, 0.1)
# Number of cores
options(mc.cores = detectCores() - 1)
```

We'll now generate the `estimates` object from the observed data (`example_confirmed`).
```{r generate-estimates}
estimates <- epinow(
  data = example_confirmed[1:60],
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(example_generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(example_incubation_period + example_reporting_delay),
  rt = rt_opts(prior = rt_prior_default, rw = 14),
  gp = NULL,
  obs = obs,
  forecast = forecast_opts(horizon = 0), # no forecasting
  output = "fit"
)
```

For the `R` data, we will set up an arbitrary trajectory and add some Gaussian noise.
```{r R-data}
# Arbitrary reproduction number trajectory
R <- c(
  rep(1.50, 20),
  rep(1.25, 10),
  rep(1, 10),
  rep(0.5, 10),
  rep(1, 10),
  1 + 0.04 * 1:20,
  rep(1.4, 5),
  1.4 - 0.02 * 1:20,
  rep(1.4, 10),
  rep(0.8, 50),
  0.8 + 0.02 * 1:20
)
# Add Gaussian noise
R_noisy <- R * rnorm(length(R), 1, 0.05)
# Plot
true_rt <- ggplot(data = data.frame(R = R_noisy)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = seq_along(R_noisy), y = R)) +
  labs(x = "Time")

plot(true_rt)
```

Let's proceed to simulate the true infections and $R_t$ data by sampling from $10$ posterior samples.
```{r true-data}
# Forecast infections and the trajectory of Rt
forecast <- forecast_infections(
  estimates$estimates,
  R = R_noisy,
  samples = 10
)
```

Let's now extract the true data for benchmarking:
- `R_true`: the median of the simulated $R_t$ values,
- `infections_true`: the infections by date of infection, and
- `reported_cases_true`: the reported cases by date of report.
```{r extract-true-data}
R_true <- forecast$summarised[variable == "R"]$median

# Get the posterior samples from which to extract the simulated infections and reported cases
posterior_sample <- forecast$samples[sample == 1]

# Extract the simulated infections
infections_true <- posterior_sample[variable == "infections"]$value

# Extract the simulated reported cases and rename the "value" column to "confirm" (to match EpiNow2 requirements)
reported_cases_true <- posterior_sample[
  variable == "reported_cases", .(date, confirm = value)
]
```

Let's see what the cases plot looks like
```{r plot-cases}
cases_traj <- ggplot(data = reported_cases_true) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = confirm)) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::label_comma()) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %d", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  labs(y = "Reported cases", x = "Date")
cases_traj
```


We will now proceed to define and run the different model options.

## Models

  )

### Configurations

We will now define the `{EpiNow2}` configurations for each model, which are modifications of the default model.
```{r model-configs, results = 'hide'}
model_configs <- list(
  # The default model with MCMC fitting
  default_mcmc = list(
    rt = rt_opts()
  ),
  # The default model with variational bayes fitting
  default_vb = list(
    rt = rt_opts(),
    stan = stan_opts(method = "vb", backend = "rstan")
  ),
  # The default model with pathfinder fitting
  default_pathfinder = list(
    rt = rt_opts(),
    stan = stan_opts(method = "pathfinder", backend = "cmdstanr")
  ),
  # The default model with laplace fitting
  default_laplace = list(
    rt = rt_opts(),
    stan = stan_opts(method = "laplace", backend = "cmdstanr")
  ),
  # The non-mechanistic model with MCMC fitting
  non_mechanistic_mcmc = list(
    rt = NULL
  ),
  # The non-mechanistic model with variational bayes fitting
  non_mechanistic_vb = list(
    rt = NULL,
    stan = stan_opts(method = "vb", backend = "rstan")
  ),
  # The non-mechanistic model with pathfinder fitting
  non_mechanistic_pathfinder = list(
    rt = NULL,
    stan = stan_opts(method = "pathfinder", backend = "cmdstanr")
  ),
  # The non-mechanistic model with laplace fitting
  non_mechanistic_laplace = list(
    rt = NULL,
    stan = stan_opts(method = "laplace", backend = "cmdstanr")
  ),
  # The 7-day RW Rt model with MCMC fitting
  rw7_mcmc = list(
    rt = rt_opts(
      prior = rt_prior_default,
      rw = 7
    )
  ),
  # The 7-day RW Rt model with variational bayes fitting
  rw7_vb = list(
    rt = rt_opts(
      prior = rt_prior_default,
      rw = 7
    ),
    stan = stan_opts(method = "vb", backend = "rstan")
  ),
  # The 7-day RW Rt model with pathfinder fitting
  rw7_pathfinder = list(
    rt = rt_opts(
      prior = rt_prior_default,
      rw = 7
    ),
    stan = stan_opts(method = "pathfinder", backend = "cmdstanr")
  ),
  # The 7-day RW Rt model with laplace fitting
  rw7_laplace = list(
    rt = rt_opts(
      prior = rt_prior_default,
      rw = 7
    ),
    stan = stan_opts(method = "laplace", backend = "cmdstanr")
  ),
  # The non_residual model with MCMC fitting
  non_residual_mcmc = list(
    rt = rt_opts(
      prior = rt_prior_default,
      gp_on = "R0"
    )
  ),
  # The non_residual model with variational bayes fitting
  non_residual_vb = list(
    rt = rt_opts(
      prior = rt_prior_default,
      gp_on = "R0"
    ),
    stan = stan_opts(method = "vb", backend = "rstan")
  ),
  # The non_residual model with pathfinder fitting
  non_residual_pathfinder = list(
    rt = rt_opts(
      prior = rt_prior_default,
      gp_on = "R0"
    ),
    stan = stan_opts(method = "pathfinder", backend = "cmdstanr")
  ),
  # The non_residual model with laplace fitting
  non_residual_laplace = list(
    rt = rt_opts(
      prior = rt_prior_default,
      gp_on = "R0"
    ),
    stan = stan_opts(method = "pathfinder", backend = "cmdstanr")
  )
)
```

## Running the models

All the models will share the configuration for the generation time, incubation period, reporting delay, and the forecast horizon, so we will define them once and pass them to the models.

```{r, constant_inputs}
# Generation time
generation_time <- Gamma(
  shape = Normal(1.3, 0.3),
  rate = Normal(0.37, 0.09),
  max = 14
)

# Incubation period
incubation_period <- LogNormal(
  meanlog = Normal(1.6, 0.05),
  sdlog = Normal(0.5, 0.05),
  max = 14
)

# Reporting delay
reporting_delay <- LogNormal(
  meanlog = 0.5,
  sdlog = 0.5,
  max = 10
)

# Combine the incubation period and reporting delay into one delay
delay <- incubation_period + reporting_delay

# 7-day forecast window
horizon <- 7

# Combine the shared model inputs into a list for use across all the models
model_inputs <- list(
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  delays = delay_opts(delay),
  obs = obs,
  forecast = forecast_opts(horizon = horizon),
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

Additionally, from the benchmarking data, we choose the following dates to represent the periods of growth, peak, and decline.
```{r snapshot_dates}
snapshot_dates <- as.Date(c("2020-05-15", "2020-06-21", "2020-06-28"))
```

Using the chosen dates, let's create the data snapshots for fitting the models.
```{r data-snapshots}
data_snaps <- lapply(
  snapshot_dates,
  function(snap_date) {
    reported_cases_true[date <= snap_date]
  }
)
names(data_snaps) <- snapshot_dates
```

Now, we're ready to run the models. We will use the `epinow()` function and return useful outputs like the timing of model runs. We obtain forecasts for the data excluding the forecast horizon and then compare the forecasts to the data including the horizon in the evaluations. This is often called an out-of-sample evaluation.
```{r run-models, results = 'hide'}
# Create a version of epinow() that works like base::try() and works even if some models fail.
safe_epinow <- purrr::safely(epinow)
# Run the models over the different dates
results <- lapply(
  data_snaps, function(data) {
    lapply(
      model_configs,
      function(model) {
        # Use subset of the data
        data_to_fit <- data[1:(.N - model_inputs$forecast$horizon)] # exclude the forecast horizon
        model_inputs <- c(model_inputs, data = list(data_to_fit))
        do.call(
          safe_epinow,
          c(
            model_inputs,
            model
          )
        )
      }
    )
  }
)
```

## Evaluating model performance

We'll begin by setting up the following functions:

- `extract_results()`: extract a subset of variables of interest ("timing", "Rt", and "infections") from an `epinow()` run.
- `get_model_results()`: apply `extract_results()` to a nested list of model runs per snapshot date.
- `add_fit_type()`: re-categorise the four(4) fitting methods into MCMC and approximate.
- `make_cols_factors` convert all columns into factor, except the columns in the `except` column.
- `add_epidemic_phase_levels()`: add factor levels to the `epidemic_phase` column to allow for easy ordering.
- `calc_crps()`: calculate the CRPS using the [scoringutils](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/) R package.
- `process_crps()`: calculate CRPS estimates for the nested list of model runs per snapshot date and flatten into a simple list.
- `add_model_details()`: Add the model components and descriptions to the results of `process_crps()`.
- `calculate_total_crps()`: calculate total CRPS for each model.
- `plot_total_crps()`: plot the total CRPS for each model.
- `plot_crps_over_time()`: # plot CRPS over time per model.

### Run times (computational resources)

Let's now see how long each model took to run. Here, we show the run times by fitting method because they approximate methods are significantly faster. Note the difference in scale in the y-axis.
```{r process-runtimes}
# Extract the run times and reshape to dt
runtimes_by_snapshot <- get_model_results(results, "timing")

# Flatten the results
runtimes_dt <- lapply(runtimes_by_snapshot, function(x) as.data.table(x)) |>
  rbindlist(idcol = "snapshot_date", ignore.attr = TRUE)

# Reshape
runtimes_dt_long <- melt(
  runtimes_dt,
  id.vars = "snapshot_date",    # Column to keep as an identifier
  measure.vars = model_descriptions$model,  # Dynamically select model columns by pattern
  variable.name = "model",      # Name for the 'model' column
  value.name = "timing"         # Name for the 'timing' column
)

# Add model configurations
runtimes_dt_detailed <- merge(
  runtimes_dt_long,
  model_components,
  by = "model"
)

# snapshot dates dictionary
snapshot_date_labels <- c(growth = "2020-05-15", peak = "2020-06-21", decline = "2020-06-28")

# Replace snapshot_date based on the dictionary
runtimes_dt_detailed[, epidemic_phase := names(snapshot_date_labels)[match(snapshot_date, snapshot_date_labels)]]

# Add model descriptions
runtimes_dt_detailed <- merge(
  runtimes_dt_detailed,
  model_descriptions,
  by = "model"
)

# Re-categorise the factor levels
runtimes_dt_detailed <- add_fit_type(runtimes_dt_detailed)

# Make all columns except timing a factor
runtimes_dt_detailed <- make_cols_factors(runtimes_dt_detailed, except = "timing")

# Add epidemic_phase factor levels to c("growth", "peak", "decline"))
runtimes_dt_detailed <- add_epidemic_phase_levels(runtimes_dt_detailed)

# Plot the timing
timing_plot <- ggplot(data = runtimes_dt_detailed) +
  geom_point(aes(x = epidemic_phase,
                 y = timing,
                 shape = model_basename,
                 color = fitting
                 ),
             position = position_dodge(width = 0.4),
             size = 3,
             stroke = 1.2
  ) +
  labs(x = "Epidemic phase",
       y = "Runtime (secs)",
       shape = "Model",
       fill = "Fitting method",
       title = "Runtimes per model and fitting method",
       caption = "Where a model is not shown, it means it failed to run"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1, 0, 6, 8)) +
  facet_wrap(~fit_type, scales = "free_y", nrow = 2, strip.position = "top") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 13),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 13),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 11)
        )
timing_plot
```

We can see that across the board, the non-mechanistic model and non-residuals models were the fastest whereas the default model was among the slowest models for all data scenarios.

### Evaluating model performance

Now, we will evaluate the performance of the models using the [continuous ranked probability score (CRPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Continuous_ranked_probability_score). The CRPS is a [proper scoring rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Propriety_and_consistency) that measures the accuracy of probabilistic forecasts. When comparing models, the smaller the CRPS, the better.

We will focus on evaluating the results of fitting with MCMC. We will also show the results for the approximate sampling methods but will not delve deeply into them as we do not recommended for full inference due to their experimental nature currently, which makes them unstable. In a latter section, we will provide ideas on how the approximate methods can be used in `{EpiNow2}` workflows.

```{r process-crps}
# Process CRPS for Rt
rt_crps <- process_crps(results, "R", R)
rt_crps_full <- add_model_details(rt_crps)

# Process CRPS for infections
infections_crps <- process_crps(results, "infections", infections_true)
infections_crps_full <- add_model_details(infections_crps)
```

As part of post-processing, we will add a "type" column to the output of the estimates to indicate which subsets are based on partial and complete data. We will get the "type" column from the default model (the same values across model outputs) and append them to the rest of the model results.
```{r estimates-types-by-date}
# Get date and fit type from the default model (the same across model outputs)
results_by_model <- list_transpose(results)

estimate_types <- lapply(
  results_by_model$non_mechanistic_mcmc,
  function(results_by_snapshot) {
    results_by_snapshot$result$estimates$summarised[
      variable == "reported_cases"][
        ,
        c("date", "type")
      ]
  }
) |>
  rbindlist(idcol = "snapshot_date")

# add the "estimate_type" column.
rt_crps_dt <- merge(
  rt_crps_full,
  estimate_types,
  by = c("date", "snapshot_date")
)

# Add the "estimate_type" column
infections_crps_dt <- merge(
  infections_crps_full,
  estimate_types,
  by = c("date", "snapshot_date")
)

# Re-categorise fit_type column and convert to factor

# Rt
rt_crps_dt <- add_fit_type(rt_crps_dt)
rt_crps_dt <- make_cols_factors(rt_crps_dt, except = c("date", "crps"))
rt_crps_dt <- add_epidemic_phase_levels(rt_crps_dt)

# Simplify the model name for downstream use
rt_crps_dt_final <- rt_crps_dt[, model := gsub("_[^_]*$", "", model)]

# Infections
infections_crps_dt <- add_fit_type(infections_crps_dt)
infections_crps_dt <- make_cols_factors(infections_crps_dt, except = c("date", "crps"))
infections_crps_dt <- add_epidemic_phase_levels(infections_crps_dt)

# Simplify the model name for downstream use
infections_crps_dt_final <- infections_crps_dt[, model := gsub("_[^_]*$", "", model)]
```

#### Model performance over time

Let's see how the $R_t$ and infections CRPS changed over time using the function `plot_crps_over_time()`. We'll start with the models fitted with MCMC.
```{r plot-rt-crps-mcmc}
# Plot CRPS over time for Rt
rt_crps_mcmc <- rt_crps_dt_final[fitting == "mcmc"]
rt_crps_mcmc_plot <- plot_crps_over_time(rt_crps_mcmc, "Time-varying model performance in estimating Rt (mcmc)")
rt_crps_mcmc_plot  +
    facet_wrap(~epidemic_phase, ncol = 1)
```

```{r plot-infections-crps-mcmc}
# Plot CRPS over time for infections
infections_crps_mcmc_dt <- infections_crps_dt_final[fitting == "mcmc"]
infections_crps_mcmc_plot <- plot_crps_over_time(infections_crps_mcmc_dt, "Time-varying model performance in estimating infections (mcmc)")
infections_crps_mcmc_plot +
    facet_wrap(~epidemic_phase, ncol = 1)
```

#### Overall model performance

Let's calculate the overall/aggregated performance of the models in terms of the total CRPS for $R_t$ and infections for downstream visualisations.

```{r calc-total-crps}
# Rt
rt_total_crps <- calculate_total_crps(rt_crps_dt_final, by = c("model", "epidemic_phase", "type", "fitting"))

# infections
infections_total_crps <- calculate_total_crps(infections_crps_dt_final, by = c("model", "epidemic_phase", "type", "fitting"))


# We are not interested in the "estimates", just "estimaes based on partial data" and "forecasts"

rt_total_crps <- rt_total_crps[type != "estimate"]
infections_total_crps <- infections_total_crps[type != "estimate"]
```


Now, let's visualise the results for MCMC fitting.
```{r crps-plotting-rt-total}
# Calculate
rt_total_crps_mcmc <- rt_total_crps[fitting == "mcmc"]

# Process data and plot
rt_total_crps_mcmc_plot <- plot_total_crps(rt_total_crps_mcmc, "Aggregated model performance in estimating Rt (mcmc)")
rt_total_crps_mcmc_plot  +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(0, 1, 17, 8)) +
  facet_wrap(~type)
```

```{r crps-plotting-infections-total}
# Calculate
infections_total_crps_mcmc <- infections_total_crps[fitting == "mcmc"]

# Process and plot
infections_total_crps_plot <- plot_total_crps(infections_total_crps_mcmc, "Aggregated model performance in estimating infections (mcmc)")
infections_total_crps_plot +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(0, 1, 17, 8)) +
    facet_wrap(~type)
```

#### Performance of approximate methods

We'll now show the performance of the approximate methods. Note that we do not recommend using them in real-world inference and analytics pipelines. We provide alternative use cases in the following sections.

Let's first look at the time varying $R_t$ and infections estimates.
```{r plot-rt-tv-crps-approx}
# Plot CRPS over time for Rt
rt_crps_approx <- rt_crps_dt_final[fitting != "mcmc"]

# Process plot data and plot
rt_tv_crps_plot_approx <- plot_crps_over_time(rt_crps_approx, "Time-varying model performance in estimating Rt (approximate methods)")
rt_tv_crps_plot_approx  +
    facet_wrap(fitting~epidemic_phase)
```

```{r plot-infections-tv-crps-approx}
# Plot CRPS over time for Rt
infections_crps_approx <- infections_crps_dt_final[fitting != "mcmc"]

# Process plot data and plot
infections_tv_crps_plot_approx <- plot_crps_over_time(infections_crps_approx, "Time-varying model performance in estimating infections (approximate methods)")
infections_tv_crps_plot_approx  +
    facet_wrap(fitting~epidemic_phase, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(caption = "Where a model is not shown, it means it failed to run")
```

Now, let's look at the total CRPS for $R_t$ and infections.
```{r plot-rt-total-crps-approx}
# Calculate total CRPS
rt_total_crps_approx <- rt_total_crps[fitting != "mcmc"]

# Process plot data and plot
rt_total_crps_approx_plot <- plot_total_crps(rt_total_crps_approx, "Aggregated model performance in estimating Rt (approximate methods)")
rt_total_crps_approx_plot +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(0, 1, 17, 8)) +
  facet_wrap(~ type + fitting) +
  labs(caption = "Where a model is not shown, it means it failed to run")
```

```{r plot-infections-total-crps-approx}
# Calculate total CRPS
infections_total_crps_approx <- infections_total_crps[fitting != "mcmc"]

# Process plot data and plot
infections_total_crps_approx_plot <- plot_total_crps(infections_total_crps_approx, "Aggregated model performance in estimating infections (approximate methods)")
infections_total_crps_approx_plot +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(0, 1, 17, 8)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ type + fitting) +
  labs(caption = "Where a model is not shown, it means it failed to run")
```

## Summary of results

Overall, the non-mechanistic model was always the fastest and had the best performance in estimating $R_t$. The default model was among the slowest models in most cases but often had the best time-varying and aggregated performance in estimating infections. The non-residual and 7-day random walk models showed mixed results. This suggests a trade-off between run times/speed and estimation/forecasting performance, here measured with the CRPS. These results show that choosing an appropriate model for a task requires carefully considering the use case and appropriate trade-offs. Below are a few considerations.

## Considerations for choosing an appropriate model

### Model types (Semi-mechanistic vs non-mechanistic)

Estimation in `{EpiNow2}` using the semi-mechanistic approaches (putting a prior on $R_t$) is often much slower than the non-mechanistic approach. The mechanistic model is slower because it models aspects of the processes and mechanisms that drive $R_t$ estimates using the renewal equation. The non-mechanistic model, on the other hand, runs much faster but does not use the renewal equation to generate infections. Because of this none of the options defining the behaviour of the reproduction number are available in this case, limiting its flexibility.

It's worth noting that the non-mechanistic model in `{EpiNow2}` is equivalent to that used in the [`{EpiEstim}`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/EpiEstim/index.html) R package as they both estimate $R_t$ from case time series and the generation interval distribution.

### Fitting methods (Exact vs approximate)

The default sampling method, set through `stan_opts()`, performs [MCMC sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) using [`{rstan}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/vignettes/rstan.html). The MCMC sampling method is accurate but is often slow. The Laplace, pathfinder, and variational inference methods are faster because they are approximate (See, for example, a detailed explanation for [automatic variational inference in Stan](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03431)).

In `{EpiNow2}`, you can use variational inference with an `{rstan}` or [`{cmdstanr}`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) backend but you must install the latter to access its functionalities. Additionally, `{EpiNow2}` supports using the [Laplace](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/laplace_sample_config.html) and [Pathfinder](https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/pathfinder_config.html) approximate samplers through the `{cmdstanr}` R package but these two methods are currently experimental in `{cmdstanr}` and have not been well tested. The approximate methods may not be as reliable as the default MCMC sampling method and we do not recommend using them in real-world inference.

The approximate methods can be used in various ways. First, you can initialise the MCMC sampling algorithm with the fit object returned by methods such as [pathfinder](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/pathfinder.html#using-pathfinder-for-initializing-mcmc). More details can be found in the original [pathfinder paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03782). This approach speeds up the initialisation phase of the MCMC algorithm. Second, the approximate methods are also great for prototyping. For example, if you are testing out a pipeline setup, it might be more practical to switch to a method like variational bayes and only use MCMC when the pipeline is up and running.

### Smoothness/granularity of estimates

The random walk method reduces smoothness/granularity of the estimates, compared to the other methods.

## Caveats of this exercise

We generated the data using an arbitrary `R` trajectory. This represents only one of many data scenarios that the models can be benchmarked against. The data used here represents abrupt rises and falls and could favour one model type or solver over another.

The run times measured here use a crude method that compares the start and end times of each simulation. It only measures the time taken for one model run and may not be accurate. For more accurate run time measurements, we recommend using a more sophisticated approach like those provided by packages like [`{bench}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bench/index.html) and [`{microbenchmark}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/microbenchmark/index.html).

Lastly, we used `r getOption("mc.cores", 1L)` cores for the simulations and so using more or fewer cores might change the run time results. We, however, expect the relative rankings to be the same or similar. To speed up the model runs, we recommend checking the number of cores available on your machine using `parallel::detectCores()` and passing a high enough number of cores to `mc.cores` through the `options()` function (See the benchmarking data setup chunk above for an example of how to do this).
