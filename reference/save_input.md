# Save Observed Data

**\[stable\]** Saves observed data to a target location if given.

## Usage

``` r
save_input(data, target_folder)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A `<data.frame>` of disease reports (confirm) by date (date).
  `confirm` must be numeric and `date` must be in date format.
  Optionally, `data` can also have a logical `accumulate` column which
  indicates whether data should be added to the next data point. This is
  useful when modelling e.g. weekly incidence data. See also the
  [`fill_missing()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/fill_missing.md)
  function which helps add the `accumulate` column with the desired
  properties when dealing with non-daily data. If any accumulation is
  done this happens after truncation as specified by the `truncation`
  argument. If all entries of `confirm` are missing (`NA`) the returned
  estimates will represent the prior distributions.

- target_folder:

  Character string specifying where to save results (will create if not
  present).

## Value

No return value, called for side effects
