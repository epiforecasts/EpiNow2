# Estimate seeding time from delays and generation time

The seeding time is set to the mean of the specified delays, constrained
to be at least the maximum generation time

## Usage

``` r
get_seeding_time(delays, generation_time, rt = rt_opts())
```

## Arguments

- delays:

  A call to
  [`delay_opts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/delay_opts.md)
  defining delay distributions and options. See the documentation of
  [`delay_opts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/delay_opts.md)
  and the examples below for details.

- generation_time:

  A call to
  [`gt_opts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/generation_time_opts.md)
  (or its alias
  [`generation_time_opts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/generation_time_opts.md))
  defining the generation time distribution used. For backwards
  compatibility a list of summary parameters can also be passed.

- rt:

  A list of options as generated by
  [`rt_opts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/rt_opts.md)
  defining Rt estimation. Defaults to
  [`rt_opts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/reference/rt_opts.md).
  To generate new infections using the non-mechanistic model instead of
  the renewal equation model, use `rt = NULL`. The non-mechanistic model
  internally uses the setting
  `rt = rt_opts(use_rt = FALSE, future = "project", gp_on = "R0")`.

## Value

An integer seeding time
