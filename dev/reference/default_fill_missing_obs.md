# Temporary function to support the transition to full support of missing data.

**\[deprecated\]**

## Usage

``` r
default_fill_missing_obs(data, obs, obs_column)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A `<data.frame>` of disease reports (confirm) by date (date).
  `confirm` must be numeric and `date` must be in date format.
  Optionally, `data` can also have a logical `accumulate` column which
  indicates whether data should be added to the next data point. This is
  useful when modelling e.g. weekly incidence data. See also the
  [`fill_missing()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/dev/reference/fill_missing.md)
  function which helps add the `accumulate` column with the desired
  properties when dealing with non-daily data. If any accumulation is
  done this happens after truncation as specified by the `truncation`
  argument. If all entries of `confirm` are missing (`NA`) the returned
  estimates will represent the prior distributions.

- obs:

  A list of options as generated by
  [`obs_opts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/dev/reference/obs_opts.md)
  defining the observation model. Defaults to
  [`obs_opts()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/dev/reference/obs_opts.md).

- obs_column:

  Character (default: "confirm"). If given, only the column specified
  here will be used for checking missingness. This is useful if using a
  data set that has multiple columns of hwich one of them corresponds to
  observations that are to be processed here.

## Value

data set with missing dates filled in as na values
