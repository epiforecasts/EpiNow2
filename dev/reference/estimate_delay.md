# Estimate a Delay Distribution

**\[maturing\]** Estimate a log normal delay distribution from a vector
of integer delays. Currently this function is a simple wrapper for
[`bootstrapped_dist_fit()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/dev/reference/bootstrapped_dist_fit.md).

## Usage

``` r
estimate_delay(delays, ...)
```

## Arguments

- delays:

  Integer vector of delays

- ...:

  Arguments to pass to internal methods.

## Value

A `<dist_spec>` summarising the bootstrapped distribution

## See also

[`bootstrapped_dist_fit()`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/dev/reference/bootstrapped_dist_fit.md)

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
delays <- rlnorm(500, log(5), 1)
estimate_delay(delays, samples = 1000, bootstraps = 10)
