All issues flagged by CRAN have been resolved. In particular the roxygen2 documentation issue that was flagged as the reason for archiving has been resolved by rebuilding the documentation.

In addition new CRAN comments flagged post archiving (i.e temporary directory usage, no examples for internal functions, and no return values) have been updated as requested where action was required.
