# EpiNow2 1.2.0

This release introduces multiple breaking interface changes. Please see the README for examples of the new interface. It also adds a range of quality of life improvements including updating the `stan` interface to support fitting each chain independently and offering variational inference as an alternative, experimental, fitting option. Notably it also adds support for nesting logging 
and a parallel enabled progress bar via the `progressr` package. Minor bugs have been fixed in the core model implementation focussing on stability with major updates planned for the next release.

## New features

* Added support for either NUTs sampling (`method = "exact"`) or Variational inference (`method = "approximate"`).
* Added `get_dist`, `get_generation_time`, `get_incubation_period` based on ideas from @pearsonca. (This leads to breaking changes with the removal of `covid_generation_times` and `covid_incubation_periods`).
* Added `setup_logging` to enable users to specify the level and location of logging (wrapping functionality from `futile.logger`). 
* Added `setup_future` to making using nested futures easier (required when using `future = TRUE`).
* Implemented progress bar support using `progressr`.
* Added timeout and timing option to `regional_epinow`
* Improved logging of warnings in `regional_epinow`
* Added inner 20% high density region.
* Added mean and sd to all reporting summaries.
* Added a summary of the growth rate and doubling time.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed y axis max for `plot_summary`.
* Fix to normalisation of delay and generation time distributions from @sbfnk. This will impact nowcast infections but not reproduction number estimate.
* Updated `discretised_gamma_pmf` (discretised truncated Gamma PMF) to constrain gamma shape and (inverse) scale parameters to be positive and finite (`alpha > 0` and `beta > 0`).
* Fixed `readLines` incomplete final line warnings.

## Other changes

* Updates the interface for specifying how output is returned.
* Moved all inherited from stan arguments into `create_stan_args` with the option to override using `stan_args`. This leads to breaking changes - see the examples for details of the new interface.
* Updated all example and documentation to reflect the new interface.
* Added a `samples` argument to `get_regional_results` to make loading in samples optional. This also allows samples to be dropped when using `regional_epinow` which reduces RAM usage.
* Cleaned up wrapper functions to move individual jobs into functions.
* Adds basic testing of high level functions and some low level unit testing.


# EpiNow2 1.1.0

* Implemented reporting templates
* Bug fix of estimate reporting
* Added additional reporting of runtime errors
* Examples for `global_map` and `country_map` expanded by @ellisp
* Improved ISO code matching in `global_map` from @ellisp
* Improvements so that data frames and tibbles are supported as inputs.
* Updated reporting templates
* Updated reporting of estimates to clearly summarise cases by infection and report date. 
* Made all region summary plots optional.
* Made reporting of decimal places more standardised across metrics. 
* README updated by @kathsherratt
* Logging added by @joeHickson
* Updated plotting to be limited to a scaling of reported data (prevents upper CIs from skewing the plot).
* Added uncertainty plot bounds to control y axis on plots for clarity purposes.
* `regional_summary` now saves input reported cases data `reported_cases.csv`.
* Added an optional no delay model where Rt is estimated directly from the data. This option is not supported when using backcalculation only.

# EpiNow2 1.0.0

* Rebased package from [EpiNow](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow/)
* Implemented backcalculation, estimation, forecasting, and bootstrapped distribution fitting.
* Added options to estimate the time-varying reproduction number using a Gaussian process (both stationary and non-stationary), combined with optional user supplied breakpoints. Alternatively a static reproduction number can be assumed which when combined with breakpoints becomes piecewise linear.
