# EpiNow2 1.0.0


* Rebased package from [EpiNow](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow/)
* Implemented backcalculation, estimation, forecasting, and bootstrapped distribution fitting.
* Added options to estimate the time-varying reproduction number using a Gaussian process (both stationary and non-stationary), combined with optional user supplied breakpoints. Alternatively a static reproduction number can be assumed which when combined with breakpoints becomes piecewise linear.
