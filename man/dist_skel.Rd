\usage{
dist_skel(
  n,
  dist = FALSE,
  cum = TRUE,
  model,
  discrete = FALSE,
  params,
  max_value = 120
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Numeric vector, number of samples to take (or days for the
probability density).}

\item{dist}{Logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}. Should the probability density be
returned rather than a number of samples.}

\item{cum}{Logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{dist = TRUE} should the returned
distribution be cumulative.}

\item{model}{Character string, defining the model to be used. Supported
options are exponential ("exp"), gamma ("gamma"), and log normal
("lognormal")}

\item{discrete}{Logical,  defaults to \code{FALSE}. Should the probability
distribution be discretised. In this case each entry of the probability
mass function corresponds to the 2-length interval ending at the entry
except for the first interval that covers (0, 1).  That is, the probability
mass function is a vector where the first entry corresponds to the integral
over the (0,1] interval of the continuous distribution, the second entry
corresponds to the (0,2] interval, the third entry corresponds to the (1,
3] interval etc.}

\item{params}{A list of parameters values (by name) required for each model.
For the exponential model this is a rate parameter and for the gamma model
this is alpha and beta.}

\item{max_value}{Numeric, the maximum value to allow. Defaults to 120.
Samples outside of this range are resampled.}
}
\value{
A vector of samples or a probability distribution.

This function acts as a skeleton for a truncated distribution defined by
model type, maximum value and model parameters. It is designed to be used
with the output from \code{\link[=get_dist]{get_dist()}}.
