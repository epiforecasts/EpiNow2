\title{Create Delay Shifted Cases}
\usage{
create_shifted_cases(reported_cases, shift, smoothing_window, horizon)
}
\arguments{
\item{reported_cases}{A data frame of confirmed cases (confirm) by date (date). confirm must be integer and date must be
in date format.}

\item{shift}{Numeric, mean delay shift to apply.}

\item{smoothing_window}{Numeric, the rolling average smoothing window
to apply. Must be odd in order to be defined as a centred average.}

\item{horizon}{Numeric, defaults to 7. Number of days into the future to forecast.}
}
\value{
A data frame for shifted reported cases
}

This functions creates a data frame of reported cases that has been smoothed using
a centred partial rolling average (with a period set by \code{smoothing_window}) and shifted back in time
by some delay. It is used by \code{estimate_infections} to generate the mean shifted prior
on which the back calculation method (see \code{backcalc_opts}) is based.
