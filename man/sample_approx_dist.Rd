\title{Approximate Sampling a Distribution using Counts}
\usage{
sample_approx_dist(
  cases = NULL,
  dist_fn = NULL,
  max_value = 120,
  earliest_allowed_mapped = NULL,
  direction = "backwards",
  type = "sample",
  truncate_future = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cases}{A dataframe of cases (in date order) with the following variables:
\code{date} and \code{cases}.}

\item{dist_fn}{Function that takes two arguments with the first being numeric and the second being logical (and
defined as \code{dist}). Should return the probability density or a sample from the defined distribution. See
the examples for more.}

\item{max_value}{Numeric, maximum value to allow. Defaults to 120 days}

\item{earliest_allowed_mapped}{A character string representing a date ("2020-01-01"). Indicates
the earliest allowed mapped value.}

\item{direction}{Character string, defato "backwards". Direction in which to map cases. Supports
either "backwards" or "forwards".}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the method to use to transform counts. Supports either "sample"
which approximates sampling or "median" would shift by the median of the distribution.}

\item{truncate_future}{Logical, should cases be truncated if they occur after the first date reported in the data.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} of cases by date of onset
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\figure{lifecycle-soft-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='Soft-deprecated lifecycle'}}{\strong{Soft-deprecated}}
Convolves cases by a PMF function. This function will soon be removed or replaced with a
more robust \code{stan} implementation.
