and the examples below for details.}

Either extracts or converts reported cases from an input data table. For output from
\code{estimate_infections} this is a simple filtering step but for output from \code{forecast_infection}
this is currently an approximate convolution. This step is likely to be updated/deprecated
in new releases as \code{forecast_infections} evolves to be based on \code{stan} functionality.
