setup_logging(
  threshold = "INFO",
  file = NULL,
  mirror_to_console = FALSE,
  name = "EpiNow2"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{Character string indicating the logging level see (?futile.logger
for details of the available options). Defaults to "INFO".}

\item{file}{Character string indicating the path to save logs to. By default logs will be
written to the console.}

\item{mirror_to_console}{Logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}. If saving logs to a file should they
also be duplicated in the console.}

\item{name}{Character string defaulting to EpiNow2. This indicates the name of the logger to setup.
The default logger for EpiNow2 is called EpiNow2. Nested options include: Epinow2.epinow which controls
all logging for \code{epinow} and nested functions, EpiNow2.epinow.estimate_infections (logging in
\code{estimate_infections}), and EpiNow2.epinow.estimate_infections.fit (logging in fitting functions).}

Sets up \code{futile.logger} logging, which is integrated into \code{EpiNow2}. See the
documentation for \code{futile.logger} for full details. By default \code{EpiNow2} prints all logs at
the "INFO" level and returns them to the console. Usage of logging is currently being explored
as the current setup cannot log stan errors or progress.
