\usage{
backcalc_opts(prior = "reports", prior_window = 14, rt_window = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{prior}{A character string defaulting to "reports". Defines the prior to use
when deconvolving. Currently implemented options are to use smoothed mean delay
shifted reported cases ("reports"), to use the estimated infections from the
previous time step seeded for the first time step using mean shifted reported cases
("infections"), or no prior ("none"). Using no prior will result in poor real time performance.
No prior and using infections are only supported when a Gaussian process is present. If observed
data is not reliable then it a sensible first step is to explore increasing the \code{prior_window} with
a sensible second step being to no longer use reported cases as a prior (i.e set \code{prior = "none"}).}

\item{prior_window}{Integer, defaults to 14 days. The mean centred smoothing window
to apply to mean shifted reports (used as a prior during back calculation). 7 days is minimum recommended
settings as this smooths day of the week effects but depending on the quality of the data and the
amount of information users wish to use as a prior (higher values equalling a less informative prior).}

\item{rt_window}{Integer, defaults to 1. The size of the centred rolling average to use when estimating
Rt. This must be odd so that the central estimate is included.}
