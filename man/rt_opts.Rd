\usage{
rt_opts(
  prior = list(mean = 1, sd = 1),
  use_rt = TRUE,
  rw = 0,
  use_breakpoints = TRUE,
  future = "latest",
  gp_on = "R_t-1",
  pop = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prior}{List containing named numeric elements "mean" and "sd". The mean and
standard deviation of the log normal Rt prior. Defaults to mean of 1 and standard
deviation of 1.}

\item{use_rt}{Logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. Should Rt be used to generate infections
and hence reported cases.}

\item{rw}{Numeric step size of the random walk, defaults to 0. To specify a weekly random
walk set \code{rw = 7}. For more custom break point settings consider passing in a \code{breakpoints}
variable as outlined in the next section.}

\item{use_breakpoints}{Logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. Should break points be used if present
as a \code{breakpoint} variable in the input data. Break points should be defined as 1 if present
and otherwise 0. By default breakpoints are fit jointly with a global non-parametric effect
and so represent a conservative estimate of break point changes (alter this by setting \code{gp = NULL}).}

\item{future}{A character string or integer. This argument indicates how to set future Rt values. Supported
options are to project using the Rt model ("project"), to use the latest estimate based on partial data ("latest"),
to use the latest estimate based on data that is over 50\% complete ("estimate"). If an integer is supplied then the Rt estimate
from this many days into the future (or past if negative) past will be used forwards in time.}

\item{gp_on}{Character string, defaulting to  "R_t-1". Indicates how the Gaussian process,
if in use, should be applied to Rt.  Currently supported options are applying the Gaussian
process to the last estimated Rt (i.e Rt = Rt-1 * GP), and applying the Gaussian process to
a global mean (i.e Rt = R0 * GP). Both should produced comparable results when data is not
sparse but the method relying on a global mean will revert to this for real time estimates,
which may not be desirable.}

\item{pop}{Integer, defaults to 0. Susceptible population initially present. Used to adjust
Rt estimates when otherwise fixed based on the proportion of the population that is
susceptible. When set to 0 no population adjustment is done.}
